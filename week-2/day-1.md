# Assignment 1 (Week 2, Day 1): Introduction to Webpack & Basic Setup

## Objective

- Understand what Webpack is and why it's used in modern web development.
- Set up a basic Webpack configuration to bundle multiple JavaScript files into one output.

## Instructions

#### Part 1 — Project setup

1. **Create your project folder and install the template**

   ```
   npx react-webpack-codex react-webpack-d1
   cd react-webpack-d1
   ```

   The command copies a full React + Webpack + Babel starter into `react-webpack-d1/`, installs all dependencies, and starts you on port 3000.

2. **Start the dev server**

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Part 2 — Clean slate for your components

1. **Remove the example UI**

   - Delete everything inside `src/components/`.

   - Open `src/App.jsx` and replace the existing markup (`<Header /> <Main /> <Footer />`) with a single empty `<div />`.

2. **Create a fresh component**

   - Inside `src/components/`, create `Greeting.jsx`:

     ```jsx
     export default function Greeting() {
       return <h1>Hello, React world!</h1>;
     }
     ```

   - Import and render it in `App.jsx`:

     ```jsx
     import Greeting from "./components/Greeting.jsx";

     export default function App() {
       return <Greeting />;
     }
     ```

#### Grading rubric (20 pts each)

| Criteria               | Incomplete (0 pts)               | Partial (10 pts)                         | Complete (20 pts)                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Template usage**     | Did not use scaffold             | Scaffold present but altered incorrectly | Project created exactly via `npx react-webpack-codex …` |
| **Component creation** | No working component             | Component present but not rendered       | Custom component renders without errors                 |
| **Build success**      | `npm run build` fails            | Builds with warnings/errors              | Builds cleanly; preview works                           |
| **Repo organization**  | Missing files or messy structure | Mostly organized                         | Clear structure; only relevant files committed          |
| **Code clarity**       | Unreadable or poor naming        | Somewhat clear                           | Well-named, formatted code                              |
