# Task (Week 6, Day 4): Exploring Advanced Testing Techniques

## Objective

- **Experiment** with advanced Jest features such as **coverage** reports and **snapshot** testing.
- **Refine** or extend the tests you wrote earlier this week.

## Instructions

1. **Enable Coverage Reports**

   - In your project’s `package.json`, update the **test script** so it includes `--coverage`.
   - Run `npm test` and observe the coverage summary (statements, branches, functions, lines) in your console.
   - Optionally open the generated coverage report files (often in a `coverage` folder) to see detailed results.

2. **Refine Your Existing Tests**

   - If you see **coverage gaps**, add or modify tests to improve coverage.
   - If you have **async code**, consider adding more scenarios (a failing fetch or error handling).

3. **Commit Your Updates**
   - Since this is **not graded**, it’s sufficient to keep your changes locally or push them to a branch on your repo for reference.

## Submission

- **No formal submission** is required for this task.
- If you want feedback, push your changes to a repository (or a separate branch) and share it with peers or instructors.
