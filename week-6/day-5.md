# Task (Week 6, Day 5): Testing Review & Practice

## Objective

- **Consolidate** your testing skills from this week (Jest setup, async testing, mocks, coverage, etc.).
- **Review** existing tests, address any remaining **errors** or **coverage gaps**.
- Optionally **experiment** with other testing patterns or libraries (like Cypress for end-to-end).

## Instructions

1. **Review Your Current Tests**

   - Revisit the projects from Days 1–4 this week.
   - Fix any **failing tests**, **mocking issues**, or **coverage** shortfalls.

2. **Add Optional Enhancements**

   - Explore features like **snapshot testing**, **integration tests** with more complex components, or **error handling** tests for your async calls.

3. **Run Coverage**

   - If you haven’t already, run `npm test -- --coverage` (adjust as needed) to see a summary of your test coverage.
   - Identify **uncovered** lines or branches and decide if you’d like to add tests.

4. **Document Any Insights**
   - In your project’s README or a separate notes file, record any **testing insights** or **tips** you learned.

## Submission

- **No formal submission** is required for this task.
- If you make improvements, consider committing them to your existing test repos so you can track your testing progress.
