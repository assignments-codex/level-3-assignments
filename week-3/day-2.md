# Task (Week 3, Day 2): Organizing React Files & Basic Routing with `useState`

## Objective

- Practice arranging React files in a logical, scalable manner.
- Experiment with a minimal routing setup (e.g., using a library like **React Router**, if you choose).
- Understand and use **useState** to manage local component state.

## Instructions

### Part 1: File Organization

1. **Decide on a Structure**
   - Continue from your **Week 3, Day 1** React app or create a new one (e.g., using Vite).
   - Plan out folders such as `components`, `pages`, and possibly `hooks` or `utils` if you find it helpful.
2. **Create a Few Components**
   - For example, a `Header` component and a couple of page components (e.g., `HomePage` and `AboutPage`).
3. **Place Files Strategically**
   - Keep each component in a separate file.
   - Consider whether any shared elements (like navigation or footers) should live in a common folder.

### Part 2: Basic Routing Setup

4. **Choose a Routing Method**
   - You might install a library (e.g., **React Router**) or use a simpler approach if youâ€™re just experimenting.
5. **Create Routes**
   - At minimum, set up two routes (e.g., Home and About) so you can switch between them in the browser.
   - Confirm you can navigate between pages.

### Part 3: Using `useState`

6. **Add State to a Component**
   - Pick one of your components (maybe `HomePage`).
   - Import `useState` from `react`.
   - Store a small piece of data in state (e.g., a counter, a message, or a user input value).
7. **Render and Update State**
   - Display your state variable on the page.
   - Provide a way to update it (e.g., a button click or an input field).

### Part 4: Verify Everything Works

- **Run Your App** and confirm you can navigate routes and see state changes.
- **Check for Errors** in your console or browser.

## Additional Notes (Non-Graded)

- If you wish, **commit** your changes to a GitHub repo (e.g., `react-routing-useState`) for personal reference or sharing.
- No rubric or official submission is required for this task, but treating it seriously will deepen your React and file-organization skills.
