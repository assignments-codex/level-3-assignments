# Assignment (Week 5, Day 3): Exploring a React Component Library

## Objective

- Install and integrate a **React component library** into your project.
- Explore at least **two** pre-built components from the chosen library.
- Demonstrate how these components can enhance your app’s UI and layout.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Project Setup

1. **Create a New React Project**
   - Use the **manual Webpack/Babel** approach from **Week 3, Day 1** (or any subsequent assignment that established the same pattern).
2. **Install Your Preferred Component Library**
   - Examples: **React-Bootstrap**, **Material-UI (MUI)**, **Chakra UI**, etc.
   - Confirm the installation is successful (e.g., `npm install react-bootstrap`).

### Part 2: Incorporate Library Components

1. **Import Components**
   - Choose at least **two** different components (e.g., a button, card, navbar).
2. **Render in Your App**
   - Add them to your main or a sample page, ensuring they display correctly.
3. **Apply Basic Props or Styles**
   - For example, change a button’s variant, or set a card’s header/title to customize its appearance.

### Part 3: Verify & Document

1. **Build and Open**
   - Ensure you can run Webpack and open your app in the browser.
   - Confirm the library components are styling/behaving as expected.
2. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Explore theming options (e.g., Material-UI’s theme, Chakra’s theme) if time allows.

## Submission

- **GitHub Repository**
  - Create or use a repository named something like `react-component-library`.
  - Include all your files (e.g., `webpack.config.js`, `.babelrc`, `src` folder) and a short **README** with any build/run instructions.

| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Manual React Setup**            | Webpack/Babel config incomplete or broken, app won’t run | Partially functioning config with some errors                  | Correctly configured project that builds and runs with no major issues         |
| **Component Library Integration** | Library not installed or no components used              | Library installed, but usage is incomplete/incorrect           | Library installed and at least two components properly imported & displayed    |
| **Props/Styling Application**     | No props or custom styles applied                        | Minimal use of props; unclear or incorrect styling adjustments | Correct usage of props; clear evidence of customizing component appearance     |
| **Code Organization & Clarity**   | Disorganized files or missing structure                  | Basic structure present, but some clarity issues               | Logical folder structure, clear naming, and easy to locate imported components |
| **Overall Functionality**         | App fails to display library components                  | Components appear but partially or with errors                 | Components function and render as expected, contributing to the UI             |
