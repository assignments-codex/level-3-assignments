# Task (Week 5, Day 4): Building a Responsive Website

## Objective

- Use your existing React knowledge to create a **responsive** layout.
- Practice handling **mobile**, **tablet**, and **desktop** breakpoints using CSS (or SASS) and possibly a **component library**.

## Instructions

1. **Set Up or Reuse a React Project**

   - You can continue with your project from Day 3 (where you integrated a component library) or create a fresh project using the same manual Webpack/Babel approach.

2. **Implement Responsive Styles**

   - Define **breakpoints** (for example, mobile screens up to 600px, tablets up to 1024px, etc.).
   - Ensure key layout elements (e.g., navigation, main content, sidebars) adjust neatly at different screen sizes.

3. **Verify on Multiple Devices/Screen Sizes**

   - Open your app in your browserâ€™s **responsive view** or on different devices.
   - Confirm that text, images, and components remain legible and properly laid out.

4. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Experiment with a grid system from a UI library or add custom media queries in your SASS/CSS to handle columns vs. single-column layouts.

## Submission

- No formal submission is required for this **task**.
- If desired, commit your responsive layout changes to GitHub to track progress and share with peers or instructors.
