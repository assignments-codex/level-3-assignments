# Task (Week 5, Day 2): Adding Simple Animations in React

## Objective

- Practice adding **sliding** or **fading** effects to a component in React.
- Optionally try out a **React animation library** such as **Framer Motion**.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Set Up a New or Existing React Project

1. **Continue** with your **Week 5, Day 1** project or create a fresh React project (using the same manual Webpack/Babel approach).
2. **Verify** it still builds and runs without errors.

### Part 2: Implement a Simple Animation

1. **Pick an Element**
   - For instance, animate the main heading or a button.
2. **Decide on an Approach**
   - **Option 1 (Vanilla CSS / SASS Animation):**
     - Create a CSS or SASS animation (e.g., `@keyframes fadeIn`) and apply it when the component mounts or on a button click.
   - **Option 2 (Framer Motion):**
     - Install `framer-motion` (`npm install framer-motion`).
     - Animate a component with `<motion.div>` and props like `initial`, `animate`, and `transition`.

### Part 3: Verify and Experiment

1. **Run Your Project**
   - Confirm you can see the animation (e.g., a fade in or slide transition).
2. **Tweak Parameters**
   - Adjust durations, easing, or trigger conditions to gain familiarity with the animation process.

### (Optional) Ideas to Explore
s
- **Multiple Animations** on different components.
- **Hover Effects** or click-based transitions.
