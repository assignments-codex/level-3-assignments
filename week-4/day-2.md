# Task (Week 4, Day 2): Expanding IAM Roles & Exploring AWS Services

> **Note:** This is a non-graded task. No rubric is provided.

## Objective

- Reinforce your understanding of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

- Create additional IAM user(s) for various roles or environments.

- Explore at least one **additional AWS service** (beyond DynamoDB) to broaden your familiarity with the AWS ecosystem.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Create Additional IAM User(s)

1. **Plan New Roles**

   - Consider creating a “dev” user for development tasks, or a “readonly” user for review/monitoring.

2. **Add the IAM User**

   - Within the AWS console, under **IAM**, create one or more new users.

   - Assign appropriate permissions or attach policies (e.g., Admin, PowerUser, or custom policies).

### Part 2: Explore an Additional AWS Service

1. **Choose a Service**

   - Examples include **S3** (object storage), **Lambda** (serverless functions), or **EC2** (virtual servers).

2. **Quick Review**

   - Read a few paragraphs or watch a short AWS video about this service’s purpose and typical use cases.

3. **Note a Key Takeaway**

   - Jot down one piece of information you found interesting or surprising about the service.

## Submission

- **GitHub Repository (Optional)**:

- **Screenshot**:

  - Capture a screenshot of your IAM console showing the new user(s) you created.

  - Add it to your notes or GitHub repo if you like.
