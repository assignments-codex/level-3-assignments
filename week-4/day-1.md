# Assignment (Week 4, Day 1): Setting Up Your AWS Dev Account & Exploring DynamoDB

## Objective

- Create an **AWS account** (using a personal or prepaid card if necessary) for development and learning.

- Understand the concept of **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) and avoid using the root account for daily tasks.

- Set up an **AWS budget** and capture a **screenshot** of it.

- Briefly explore **DynamoDB** documentation to prepare for upcoming lessons.

## Instructions

### Part 1: AWS Account Creation

1. **Sign Up for AWS**

   - If you already have one, verify you can access it.

   - If you cannot create an account (due to billing or regional issues), let your instructor know immediately.

2. **IAM User Setup**

   - Create a new IAM user with Administrator access (or a similar role) for daily work.

   - Log in as the new user instead of using the root account.

### Part 2: AWS Budget & Screenshot

1. **Set Up a Budget**

   - In the AWS Billing console, create a budget to monitor costs (e.g., a monthly budget of $5, $10, or an amount you are comfortable with).

   - Configure at least one budget alert so you’ll be notified before going over your limit.

2. **Capture Screenshot**

   - Take a **screenshot** showing your budget settings or confirmation.

### Part 3: Explore DynamoDB Documentation

1. **Visit the DynamoDB Docs**

   - Briefly skim AWS’s DynamoDB documentation to understand what DynamoDB is and the kind of use cases it covers.

2. **Write One Key Insight**

   - In a short comment or note, mention something interesting or surprising you learned about DynamoDB (e.g., its speed, flexibility, pricing model, etc.).

## Submission

- **GitHub Repository**:

  - Create a repository (named something like `aws-setup`) and include a Markdown file (`README.md`) with:

    - A short summary of what you did.

    - The **screenshot** of your AWS budget setup.

    - Your one key insight about DynamoDB.
