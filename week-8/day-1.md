# **Week 8: Capstone Overview and Instructions (Level 3)**

## **Deployment and Submission**

- You must **build and deploy** your React application to a suitable hosting platform (e.g., **Netlify** or **GitHub Pages**).
- You must **submit** both your **live site URL** and your **project repository link** (e.g., GitHub).

## **Theme**

- You may select **any theme** (e.g., ecommerce, nonprofit, social media). The theme itself is for context only and **will not be graded** directly.
- Focus on the **technical requirements** and best practices learned throughout the course.

## **Requirements**

1. **Advanced React Project Setup**

   - Use a manual build process with **Webpack/Babel** (or your established setup from previous weeks).
   - Demonstrate **component-based architecture** (multiple files, clear organization).

2. **AWS or Database Integration**

   - Read and/or write data from an external data source (e.g., DynamoDB on AWS or another database service).
   - Show evidence of **CRUD** functionality (create, read, update, delete) where applicable.

3. **Styling & Responsiveness**

   - Utilize **Tailwind CSS** or another styling approach covered this course.
   - Ensure your layout is **responsive** across different device sizes.

4. **JavaScript & React Fundamentals**

   - Show custom **functions**, **variables**, and an **array** that’s iterated over to render data (e.g., using `.map()` in React).
   - Implement at least a basic form or interactive feature demonstrating state management.

5. **Testing**

   - Include a **Jest** test (or tests) to validate a core component or function.
   - Demonstrate you can run these tests and interpret results.

6. **Presentation (Live Demo)**
   - You will **present** your project, explaining your architecture, data integration, styling choices, and tests.
   - Show that you understand the code you wrote.

## **Rubric (Total: 100 Points)**

### **1. Project Setup & Deployment (10 points)**

- Successful **build and deployment** on Netlify, GitHub Pages, or similar.
- Links to **repo** and **live site** are provided and functional.

<small>All must be met for full points.</small>

---

### **2. AWS/Database Integration (20 points)**

- Reads/writes data to an external source (e.g., DynamoDB).
- Basic **CRUD** logic is implemented and functional.

<small>Full points require clear evidence of create/read/update/delete operations.</small>

---

### **3. Tailwind & Responsiveness (15 points)**

- Tailwind or another styling method is evident.
- The site is **responsive** (does not break on mobile/tablet).

<small>Both styling and responsiveness are required for full points.</small>

---

### **4. JavaScript & React Fundamentals (25 points)**

Demonstrate:

1. **Custom functions** in React.
2. **Variables** used effectively (state or otherwise).
3. An **array** (e.g., `.map()`) to render multiple items in the UI.

<small>All three sub-items must be fulfilled for full points.</small>

---

### **5. Testing** (15 points)

- At least one **Jest** test exists for a key component or function.
- The test runs successfully (`npm test` or equivalent).

<small>To receive all 15 points, the test must pass and be relevant to your project’s core logic.</small>

---

### **6. Presentation & Code Explanation (15 points)**

1. **Live Demo** (10 points)

   - Screen-share your final build, demonstrate main features and data flow.

2. **Code Explanation** (5 points)
   - Show you understand your code’s structure, data integration, and styling approach.

<small>Meeting both parts fully awards 15 points.</small>

---

## **What to Expect in the Final Presentation**

1. **Live Demo**
   - Walk through your app’s features, including AWS/DB data flow and responsive design.
2. **Q&A**
   - Be prepared to **show your code** (React components, test file, etc.) and explain how each part works.
3. **Scoring**
   - Each section above must be **fully addressed** to earn maximum points.

---

## **Final Tips**

- **Plan thoroughly**: Ensure your AWS/database integration is stable and tested.
- **Check responsiveness**: Test on various screen sizes or use dev tools.
- **Practice** explaining your data flow, React components, and test approach.
- **Verify** your deployment link works before submitting.

Build something that **demonstrates your mastery** of Level 3 concepts. Good luck!
