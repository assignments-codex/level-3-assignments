# Week 7, Day 5 (Assignment): Final Deployment & Submission

## Objective

- **Deploy** your pet adoption website (or chosen project theme) to a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify).
- **Submit** your final repository link and **live URL** for review and feedback.

## Instructions

1. **Deployment Setup**

   - If using **Netlify**:
     - Create an account (if you havenâ€™t already).
     - Configure a **new site** that points to your project repo or a built folder (`dist`).
     - Set any **environment variables** if needed (AWS credentials, etc.).
   - Alternatively, use **GitHub Pages** or another service you prefer.

2. **Build Your Project**

   - Run your Webpack build command (e.g., `npm run build`).
   - Ensure the final build outputs a usable production bundle.

3. **Confirm Working App**

   - After deployment, open the live URL to **test** each core feature (CRUD, styling, tests).
   - Check for console errors or broken links.

4. **Update README**

   - Provide instructions on how to:
     - **Install** dependencies,
     - **Build** the project,
     - **Run tests**,
     - **View** the live site URL.

5. **Submit Your Final Project**
   - **GitHub Repo Link**: Where instructors/peers can see your code.
   - **Live URL**: The deployed site (Netlify or other hosting).
