# Week 7, Day 1 (Task): Planning & Initial Setup

## Objective

- **Plan** core features for your Pet Adoption website.
- **Create** a new React project (manual Webpack/Babel or a similar approach).
- **Initialize** a DynamoDB table for storing pet data.
- **Push** your initial setup to a GitHub repository.

## Instructions

1. **Feature Planning**

   - Sketch out a few key features: e.g., listing available pets, adding new pets, marking a pet as adopted.
   - Decide on the data fields you need in your DynamoDB table ( `id`, `name`, `age`, `status`).

2. **React Project Setup**

   - Create a new folder and initialize (`npm init -y`).
   - Install and configure **React**, **Webpack**, and **Babel** (reference earlier week templates if needed).
   - Verify you can build and open a minimal React app in your browser.

3. **DynamoDB Table Creation**

   - Using the AWS console (or CLI), create or reuse a table for your pet data.
   - Make note of the table name and region for your React app to access.

4. **GitHub Repository**
   - Initialize or create a new GitHub repo (`pet-adoption-project`).
   - Commit your base project files (React setup, any early structure).

> **No solution code** is required here; focus on **planning** and **establishing** your project environment.
