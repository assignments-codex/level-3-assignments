# Week 7, Day 3 (Task): Enhancing Layout with Tailwind & Optional Library

## Objective

- **Install and configure Tailwind CSS** in your existing React project.
- **Improve layout and styling** for your pet adoption pages.
- **Optionally** add a component library (e.g., DaisyUI) to speed up UI development.

## Instructions

1. **Tailwind Setup**

   - Install and configure Tailwind CSS (including a `tailwind.config.js` file).
   - Include Tailwind in your build process (e.g., import it in your main CSS or SCSS).

2. **Layout Improvements**

   - Replace or enhance your minimal styling with Tailwind classes.
   - Aim for a more modern, clean layout (e.g., responsive grid or flex layout).

3. **Optional Library**

   - Install a library like **DaisyUI** (for pre-styled components) or another Tailwind-based library.
   - Use at least one or two of its components (e.g., cards, buttons) to streamline UI work.

4. **Animations or Transitions**

   - Experiment with Tailwind’s built-in classes for transitions, hover effects, or small animations.
   - Keep it simple—just enough to show you can add interactive touches.

5. **Preview & Commit**
   - Build your project to confirm everything displays as intended.
   - Push your changes to GitHub, noting your styling improvements.
